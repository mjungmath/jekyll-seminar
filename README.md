# jekyll-seminar

This is a minimal example of a seminar page with events using Jekyll. I couldn't find anything out there that fit my purposes. That is why I made my own seminar theme.

This theme is based on [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

## Features

* Downloadable ics-file of upcoming events
* Page for each event that lists speaker, start and end time, and location of the event
* Seminar page listing all upcoming and past events with link to ics-file (no pagination support yet)

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
